Project Description:

I worked on a business project focused on addressing high cancellation rates in both city hotels and resort hotels. The objective was to improve efficiency in revenue generation and provide effective business advice to tackle this problem. 

The project involved analyzing hotel booking cancellations, as well as exploring other factors that impact the hotels' business and yearly revenue. I made several assumptions to guide my analysis, including the absence of significant events between 2015 and 2017 that would have a lasting impact on the data used. I also assumed that the information I gathered was current and applicable to analyze potential plans for the hotels.

Using data visualizations and analysis, I presented key findings to understand the extent of reservation cancellations. A bar graph depicted the percentage of canceled reservations compared to those that were not canceled, highlighting a significant number of cancellations. This finding indicated the negative impact on the hotels' earnings, with 37% of clients canceling their reservations.

Furthermore, I examined reservation status in different locations and found that city hotels had more bookings compared to resort hotels. This observation suggested that resort hotels might be perceived as more expensive than city hotels.

To understand the relationship between average daily rates (ADR) and cancellations, I utilized a line graph. It revealed that resort hotels experienced higher ADR on certain days, particularly weekends and holidays. Additionally, I analyzed reservation status on a monthly basis, identifying the highest and lowest reservation levels. August had the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, while January had the highest number of cancellations.

Another crucial finding was that cancellations were more common when prices were higher and less common when prices were lower. This insight emphasized the significant impact of accommodation costs on reservation cancellations.

Based on the analysis, I proposed several suggestions for the hotels to address the issue of high cancellation rates. These recommendations included implementing pricing strategies to lower rates for specific hotels based on their locations, improving the quality of hotels and services in Portugal, launching campaigns and offering exceptional service in January, and providing reasonable discounts during weekends and holidays.

Overall, my project aimed to identify the factors contributing to high cancellation rates in city hotels and resort hotels, and to provide actionable recommendations for improving revenue generation and efficiency.
